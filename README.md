# Financial Inclusion Analysis in Nigeria

## Project Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for analyzing financial inclusion in Nigeria using data from the **Global Findex 2021** dataset. The analysis explores account ownership, digital payment adoption, mobile money usage, barriers to financial inclusion, and saving/borrowing patterns.

## Key Research Questions
1. How does account ownership (financial institution and/or mobile money) vary by gender, age, education level, and income quintile in Nigeria?
2. How do economic opportunity indicators like wage receipt and government transfers differ between urban and rural areas?
3. What is the adoption rate of digital payment methods in Nigeria, and how does this vary by demographic factors?
4. What is the adoption rate of mobile money in Nigeria, and how does this vary by demographic factors?
5. What are the primary barriers to account ownership (financial institution and mobile money) in Nigeria?
6. What percentage of Nigerians save or borrow money, and what channels are most commonly used?

## Data Sources
- **Global Findex 2021 Dataset**: Individual-level data on financial inclusion indicators, including account ownership, mobile money usage, digital payment adoption, and barriers to account ownership.
- **World Bank Microdata Library**: The dataset is publicly available through the World Bank Microdata Library.

## Analysis Methods
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating percentages and weighted averages to understand financial inclusion metrics.
- **Chi-square Tests**: Assessing statistical significance between demographic factors and financial inclusion indicators.
- **Visualization**: Using bar plots, heatmaps, and box plots to visualize patterns and trends.
- **Weighted Analysis**: Applying survey weights to ensure representative results.

## Key Findings

1. **Digital Payment Adoption**:
   - Digital payment adoption is influenced by gender, education, income, urban/rural status, and employment.
   - Higher education and income levels correlate with higher digital payment adoption.

2. **Mobile Money Adoption**:
   - Mobile money adoption is lower compared to traditional financial institution accounts but follows similar demographic trends.
   - Urban residents and employed individuals show higher mobile money adoption rates.

3. **Barriers to Account Ownership**:
   - The primary barriers include lack of money, cost, documentation requirements, and distance to financial institutions.
   - Financial constraints are the most significant barrier to financial inclusion.

4. **Saving and Borrowing Patterns**:
   - A significant percentage of Nigerians save and borrow money, with formal financial institutions being the most common channel.
   - Informal savings clubs and family/friends are also widely used for saving and borrowing.
